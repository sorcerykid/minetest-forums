			<div class="content">wow, that issues is not so new ... what I found ...<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/6114" class="postlink">Detection of dirty clients #6114</a><br /><br />10.07.2017 until 01.07.2017 - also with a post from &quot;beyondlimits&quot;<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Think about doing it server side, where user has no control.<br /><br />*    Moving too fast - First let server and client synchronize their times. This can be current UNIX timestamp, server uptime or whatever increments at constant rate. Then everytime the player moves a little, client sends their new position with timestamp, so that server can determine whether the movement was legal and bring player back to the last valid position. Timestamps are here so that it should work well with no-clip enforcement even in case of lags.<br />*    Peeking through walls - Does this constitue a cheat at all? Map chunks are sent as a whole and client receives full information of completely covered rooms. Minecraft does the same, and I currently have no idea how to handle it other way.<br />*    Interacting through walls - Along with the interaction, a player's position, yaw and pitch should be sent so server can determine whether it was really possible to interact with the object.<br />*    Passing through walls / flying - What cheating we're talking about? It was f'd up something that should be done at the beginning of development of this game.<br />*    Invulnerability - F'd up. Without strikethrough. Player health status was implemented client-side (yikes! who does that?). I think it was fixed recently. If so, &quot;finally&quot; is a good word.<br />*    Lighting - Sorry, you have no control over how it is displayed on user's screen. Even if a client had to prove it is legitimate, an user can still tweak his monitor settings. Isn't that an overkill. Devs already made this game painfully dark at the times, so I had to modify the lightmap in binary using the hex editor. It was fun to play (and the &quot;cheat&quot; even mitigated some graphical atrocities), until next version came out.<br />*    Ores - back when I played Minecraft, on some servers there was an anti-cheat module that efficiently prevented players from searching ores by non-legitimate ways (like X-ray). The map chunk was sent to the client, but every ore occluded from all 6 sides was sent as stone. When an user dug one of the neighboring blocks, server sent a packet to change previously hidden stone into ore. Many servers however had a frustrating version of this mod, where random stones appeared as false ores.<br />*    Looking inside chests of other players - Server along with chunk sends metadata that contains list of items in locked chests. It's in Lua scripts, not in C code. Plus of this solution is that an owner of the chest can see their items without waiting until lag passes. Minus however is that technically anyone can see what's inside.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />and what does it tell me .. nothing happened yet.</div>

			<div class="content">None of these are definitive indicators of cheating nor of a hacked client. And quite honestly, I think it's scary that anybody is actually using such &quot;criteria&quot; to block potentially legitimate players. Allow me to elaborate on each point:<br /><br /><ul><span style="font-weight: bold">player name</span><br />Wrong. There are ordinary users that have digits in their name, sometimes to indicate the year they were born, their age, or because an existing name was taken.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">no move (same position) but keep running (most followed by time out)</span><br />Wrong. This can be caused by network latency. Mobile users are esp. vulnerable to packet loss and high pings due to cell tower distance or wi-fi reception.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">often login and logout by &quot;times out&quot;</span><br />Wrong. Many factors can contribute to dropouts, including faulty router settings, defective ethernet cables, operating system bugs, surges in network traffic, etc.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">sorted (gold-)chest, even sort is OFF</span><br />Wrong. There are users that obsessively sort their chests (even gold ores) not because they are cheating, but because they are anal retentive about organization.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">open chests (view) that doesn't close anymore</span><br />Wrong. The chest lid stuck open is a bug is in Minetest game, and has no direct correlation with cheating. I can reproduce this same behavior with the official client.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">can fast, fly - maybe noclip</span><br />Wrong. Even poor network performance can give the impression of noclip and fly and fast. Try switching your laptop to airplane mode, and you can do all of these!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">have creative</span><br />Wrong. No user can &quot;have creative&quot; at will, unless your server is poorly configured or your mods are untested/ outdated. Privileges are determined by the server.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">can store 65535 same items in his inventory, not only 99</span><br />Wrong. The server is responsible for maintaining user inventories. This sounds like a serious bug in on of your mods if a user has suspiciously large stack counts.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">just with login they have diamond armor (that is cheat ! my server))</span><br />Wrong. No user can just &quot;have diamond armor&quot;, unless you have serious bugs in your mods. The client has no authority to manipulate the server-side inventory.<br /></ul>Also it's an oxymoron to describe unwanted players as &quot;guests&quot;, because <span style="text-decoration: underline">all players are guests on a public server</span>, except the owner and adminstrator. Any server that disallows guests would be empty 24/7.<br /><br />Imagine if I were to open up a bar  or a restaurant and post a prominent sign on the front window &quot;NO GUESTS ALLOWED&quot;. I would be out of business in one month, after the first lease/mortgage payment comes due.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>sorcerykid wrote:</cite>&lt;!-- snip --&gt;</div></blockquote><br />Came here to say this.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Festus1965 wrote:</cite><span style="font-weight: bold">sorted (gold-)chest, even sort is OFF</span><br />wrong, as I meant they are touching my locked gold-chests, which I never sort, as I sort my way, but when they had access (a window or on a public place) they have been sorted from them</div></blockquote><br />Players shouldn't be able to access locked chests, regardless of what client they're using. If players are able to do this, it's more likely that there's a bug/vulnerability in a mod that you are using (as sorcerykid suggested). In that case any player could potentially exploit it, not just those using unofficial clients.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Festus1965 wrote:</cite><span style="font-weight: bold">can fast, fly - maybe noclip</span><br />wrong, we should analyze what a flying or noclip mean in the game. <br />fly mean be longer time a view nodes over an node that is not passable, mean to stand on - and it is not a falling, flying is an constant longer sequeny of not follow the gravity and change directions that NOT fix to falling or jumping actions<br />noclip is also indication, as surrounded of solid nodes over some time, sure I can dig in someone, but then he cant move, but theese guys just have seen on SONOS last week are long time IN several different positions without any air or air-like node<br />fast is more difficult, but as most used in combination ... sure can detect it for 80%</div></blockquote><br />Network latency cannot allow &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;fly&quot;, and &quot;noclip&quot; for real but it can create effects that look the same. For example, if a player jumps and then lags at the top of the jump, it may look like they are hovering in the air for a few seconds. If they walk along while jumping, particularly over obstacles, it can look like they are flying. Similarly, if a player walks from point A to point B but lags while walking, to other players it will look like they were standing at point A for some time and then ran (fast) or even teleported to point B. Not completely sure about noclip but I think lag can sometimes cause players to end up inside blocks.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Festus1965 wrote:</cite><span style="font-weight: bold">can store 65535 same items in his inventory, not only 99</span><br />oh thanks, then I think there is no any save server here, as I use only mods out of minetest.mods, don't change them and other things, as I am not able to do this - but your answer indicates that I could do it also as server is miss configured or mods.

You should be tracking the player's username, not their IP address. Players can connect from different IP addresses so you could have an existing (older) player connecting from a new IP address. If you track the IP address it will look like its the first time they've connected but if you track the username you'll see that their account is older. Not sure what user tracking/management mod you're using but it should be able to tell you the first login time or login count for a particular username rather than the IP address. IP addresses only become important if you've got a player creating multiple accounts to get around a ban.<br /><br />In general, it appears that you may have some vulnerable mods on your server. Make sure that you are using up-to-date versions of all of the mods. Be especially careful if you have mods such as worldedit, or mods offering similar &quot;edit anything&quot; abilities to server admins, hackers can cause considerable damage if these mods are configured incorrectly or contain a vulnerability themselves (I believe worldedit had such a vulnerability a few years ago).<br /><br />It would also be helpful to try to better understand concepts such as network latency/lag and what effects it has on the game, or what can happen if a player's client crashes or their connection drops for some reason. Many of the issues that you have described can be caused by this and aren't indicative of players using unofficial clients (or trying to cheat in any way).</div>

Suppose player &quot;Alice&quot; connects from IP address X, players for some time and then gets diamond armor (legitimately, not cheating). Then they come back tomorrow and connect from IP address Y, because their ISP changed their IP address (not the player deliberately changing IP address to cheat, it just happens). So you see a player join with diamond armor, you look at their IP address (Y) and see that this is the first time that they have connected and it looks like they are cheating. But if you look at the player's name (&quot;Alice&quot;) you will see that they had already joined yesterday but from a different IP address.</div>

Although this only helps if the mod developer uses releases, which some don't.

There is/was also a vulnerability where other players can change the names of labelled chests. Update the technic mod and if it still happens please report this as an issue on the technic mod.</div>
