			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>neoh4x0r wrote:</cite>EDITED TO ADD: This problem is solvable but only without having the pre-conditions &quot;being a non-destructive and non-restrictive solution&quot;.</div></blockquote><br /><br />EDIT: csm_restriction_flags seems to include the ability to disable calls from the client to get_item_def and get_node_def (the call is disabled on the server, not the client, to enforce the restriction).<br /><br />So, a possible compromise could be to add extra flags to csm_restriction_flags to rate_limit the number of calls to those functions (like with get_node / csm_restriction_noderange).<br />----------<br /><br />For instance, moving the ability to read the ore-data from the client to the server would allow the following scenario:<br /><br />1) Client requests nodes (including the associated ore data) from the server<br />2) The server sends the data for (a server-side configurable number of) nodes surrounding the player (or around a specified location)<br />3) The client requests the same data again (either the same location or a different location)<br />4) The server rejects the request (and it won't send the data to the client until (a server-side configurable) amount of time has passed. Ie a cool-down period.<br /><br />This doesn't defeat ore-detect, per se, or CSMs, but it does prevent the client from having an unfair advantage (ie seeing all nodes with ore-data everywhere).<br /><br />This is a completely viable solution, but it would require an updated client and for ore-detect (and other CSM mods) to be modified to make a call to the server to get the ore-data.<br /><br />Like I was saying before, there isn't any good way to do this (&quot;to defeat ore-detect&quot;) without &quot;cracking a few eggs.&quot; (and breaking those &quot;pre-conditions&quot;)</div>

However, it is not without a caveat in that it would make mining/digging less important (which is one of the minetest's core gameplay features).<br /><br />For instance, to place less importance on mining/digging for ores (even from common to more scarce ones) would be to setup various tasks, jobs, etc and a player is rewarded for the time spent with various levels of ores, the more time spent performing the task would give more rare/scarce ores.<br /><br />Like I said, in my opinion, while it is a viable solution -- it makes one of minetest's core gameplay features less important and, to me, making a core gameplay feature less important is technically destructive (it takes away from the game).<br /><br />Furthermore, it doesn't solve the problem completely, because it requires that players actually want to earn ores by taking on jobs -- the players that chose to cheat using ore-detect (that is the ones causing the issue) are unlikely to want to work for them and, in that case, it doesn't fundamentally solve the issue.<br /><br />Which is why I said that a compromise would have to made somewhere.</div>
