			<div class="content">I have to agree with Linuxdirk. It is a glaring double standard the way that sex, which is typically beneficial to the species and motivated by love and compassion, is deemed one of the most taboo subjects in Western culture. Even nudity, which doesn't pose a harm to anybody, is deemed shameful and degrading.<br /><br />In contrast, fighting and guns and bombs and killing are regarded as wholesome, family entertainment. In particular, motion pictures, and computer games routinely cash-in on the popularity of violence and destruction and warfare. What could be more beneficial, than teaching children the importance of harm and suffering?<br /><br />Here's an article on PsychologyToday that touches upon the subject rather well:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Should entertainment merchants make child protection decisions?</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-fantasy-becomes-reality/201106/sex-is-too-obscene-kids-violence-isnt-brown-v-entertainment">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog ... ertainment</a><!-- m --><br /><br />For how civilized humans pretend to be, we certainly have a very twisted moral compass. Most of our cultural values and ethical standards today are not even derived from science and reason, moreless a quest for greater enlightenment. Instead we are guided by social norms and religious dogmas and political agendas, and a variety of indoctrinated stereotypes, generalizations, ideologies, biases, and prejudices -- which are continuously filtered and then amplified through the echo chambers of social media and mainstream news.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, the standards by  which we evaluate the content of computer games, reinforces these same attitudes. But in the end, this debate is almost meaningless with respect to a project like Minetest, because the  individuals hosting these online services ultimately are doing so of their own accord and at their own expense. This isn't a corporate enterprise nor a government agency; we are not paying for privileges nor are we voting for rights. It's a free open-source software platform maintained by volunteers. There is no obligation nor requirement on the part of the Minetest team to conform to any specific demands of end-users. <br /><br />Now, if somebody wants to start an alternative content database with more liberal guidelines, then all the more power to them.</div>

			<div class="content">First:<br />rubenwardy is 100% right.  It's his website, his rules.  Sheesh people, come on.  Someone provides free hosting and folks complain because he doesn't want to host certain kinds of content.  If someone invited you to come to a party at their house, but stipulated, &quot;No alcoholic beverages&quot; would you feel you had to gripe complain and whine because you only got free chips, dips, and soda?  Be nice.  Say thanks.  And if you feel a need for something else, pay to host it yourself.<br /><br />Second:<br />This isn't about censorship.  The point as I see it, (besides the above I mean) is quite simple:  <span style="font-weight: bold">Do you want the broadest audience possible for minetest?</span><br />If you do, then our primary sites, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.minetest.net">http://www.minetest.net</a><!-- m -->, this forum, and our main content provider, should be something that doesn't offend huge numbers of parents.  <br /><br />Why on earth would you alienate a significant portion of your potential audience by hosting content generally deemed offensive that can EASILY be hosted elsewhere?  That would be a colossally stupid idea.<br /><br />And, as rubenwardy pointed out, its not like we are trying to cut out a huge portion of the content.<br /><br />So, I'd like to say thank you to our hosts, and please ignore the whiners.  The majority of us are very grateful for the time, effort, and money you put into this project.</div>

			<div class="content">I really gotta wonder why someone would <span style="font-style: italic">strongly</span> promote sexual content in a game that is more kid friendly than not.  I really gotta wonder.....<br /><br />If you want sex in your video game, go buy an off the shelf, rated mature game that actually includes something that could remotely be enjoyed as <span style="font-style: italic">sexual</span> content.  Cartoon sex.  Video game sex.  Go get a girlfriend.  Really!<br /><br />Blocky characters and sex just don't really seem to fit.  Kinda like getting aroused over a geometric shape.  Huh...?!?!?!?!<br /><br />If you really do want sexualized content that is available for MT, here's a BRILLIANT IDEA!  Host your very own MT Sex CDB.  Apply whatever standards you want.  Problem solved.</div>

			<div class="content">Creating a competing Content DB is impractical for now because there is no simple and convenient way to switch the Content DB URL in Minetest.<br />And even if you'd do this, you would then immediately miss out on the mods on the “official” Content DB. You would have to switch between Content DBs back and forth all the time whenever you want to access the mods of that “other” Content DB. Also, it would split the modding community even more. Sorry, that's just a really crappy and user-hostile solution!<br /><br />I'm not against having competing Content DBs, but for them to be realistically possible, there need to be … Gasp! … engine changes.</div>

			<div class="content">The suggestion to have a seperate CDB for adult content was really more of a <br /><br />If you want sex content in a KIDS game, the go creep out somewhere else.  No sex content based CDB ever needs to be &quot;officially&quot;, &quot;unofficially&quot;, or otherwise linked to from within a game that is HEAVILY advertised to kids.<br /><br />Are you serious!?!  Does someone maybe need to report to the authorities?  I'm glad that MT, unlike MC or Roblox, does not and will not advertise from within the game any content that is NOT APPROPRIATE for children.  My method of parenting.  If sexualized content is EVER &quot;officially&quot; added to MT, I will very proactively denounce MT as a pedo tool.  Let's not provoke a concerned parent.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT:<br />Look, my words here are my position.  HOWEVER, the forums are not at issue here.  There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with posting adult themed mods here in the forum.  Why?  Because, when my kid is in game, browsing around in the tabs, the LAST thing I want him to see is inappropriate content, streamed right into his game.<br /><br />The forums require a little more effort, and are not mention, to my knowledge, from within the game.  Therefore, kids are not immediately exposed to adult content.  No parent can watch their child 24/7.  Your expectation that I do is more unrealistic than me expecting you to just get it.  If you have kids, you might get it.  If you do not have kids, you will never get it until you do.<br /><br />I am just a parent, to my kid, and to kids in the neighborhood who not even mine, and to whom I proactively promote MT as a great game for them to play.  Let's not make that particular job, a free advertiser of MT, more difficult than it should be.</div>

			<div class="content">@Wuzzy,<br /><br />My sincerest apologies to anyone who is actually arguing the licensing issue, which is at the heart of this discussion, and yet lost in the censorship debate.  I do not accuse anyone of anything, BUT, as a parent, I will always question the mentality and intentions of those who promote inappropriate content to children.<br /><br />I am a parent.  When I take my child to the local park, I immediately call into question, and perhaps call the authorities, when I observe ANYONE acting in a way that is not appropriate to the situation.  The guy off to the side, being the creep.  Stranger Danger.  This is what we HAVE to teach our kids.  Don't blame me for this, blame the creeps.<br /><br />The internet is the public park, in this case.  Let's not try to separate the two.  The creep at the park is of the same mentality as the person lurking behind a keyboard, pushing inappropriate content.  Sorry, I am a parent.  This is how it is.  This isn't gonna change, until the creeps stop being creeps.  Don't get mad at me for protecting my child.  Get mad at the creep.  Shame them.  Call them out.<br /><br />As for the licensing issues that are actually at the heart of this discussion, there is no problem with the adult content.  I am just asking for discretion.  For my child.  When in game, the CDB is just a tab away, and inappropriate content, that could be DETRIMENTAL to his well being, would too readily available.  Here on the forums, which are NOT accessible in game, there is absolutely no problem with the innappropriate content.  My own opinions regarding sexualized content in a kids game aside, the forums are the appropriate location to host and promote those mods.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Second Life / Opensimulator, you'll get the following analogies.  Second Life is/was a commercial, proprietary sandbox world.  A centralized server was hosted by Linden Labs, and this was the Second Life universe.  Second Life/Linden Labs had in place policies to limit the interactions of adults and children, they had age verification controls, and the client/viewer app had links to the forums built in, and their was just no way to prevent kids and adults from interacting.<br /><br />Users began to rebel. They wanted land.  They wanted more control.  They wanted less restrictions.<br /><br />Thus was born Opensimulator, an open source, protocol compliant alternative.  Opensim was great, you could host your own servers, and using one of the SecondLife based open source clients, one could have complete control over their virtual sandbox world.  Very importantly, concerned parents could better manage the use of the technology by their children.  To this day, if I run the OS server, I have no problems allowing my son to use the software.<br /><br />I would never have recommended to a parent to allow their child into Second Life, but did and still do actively promote the Opensim alternative as a local option, that could still be shared amongst friends.<br /><br />MT is at this stage.  But is one step better.  It is FAR more kid friendly out of the box.  I'd simply like to encourage maintaining this.<br /><br />Sorry for all the vitriol here.  I gotta keep my kid safe.  I do hope, from one modder and community member to another, that you would also have good intentions, understand my position, and forgive me my failures.<br /><br />Wuzzy,     Thank you for calling me out about my strongly worded opinions and reminding me that we do all need to get along.  :)</div>

			<div class="content">Rewinding back to the original post, it seems that we want a PEGI3 rating and someone pointed out that, in addition to what ContentDB may or may not host, public servers are like a Pandora box. I believe that because both are features are easily and directly accessible from the game GUI, MT would also be held responsible for what is there (if it provides access to game servers, it seems to me only logical from the PEGI perspective that those servers also comply).<br /><br />PEGI3 is actually handy because it excludes anything even slightly questionable or dangerous, so accepting or rejecting contents and features is easy to decide, no grey area.<br /><br />Here is an idea: include in the MT distribution an image file, if possible the PEGI 3 logo itself. If MT finds this file, it does <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> display the server list (don't open the Pandora box) and the mods list only shows PEGI3-tagged mods. When the file is not there, the server list is displayed and the mods not filtered. The PEGI3 image also of course not displayed in the GUI.<br /><br />The reasoning is that on Android, the platform used in majority (I think) by the audience we are concerned about, file system access is not &quot;easy&quot;. On the desktop machines, it is way easier. In both cases, if you let a child play will the file system the machine will probably wrecked very soon.<br /><br />Moreover, from the PEGI perspective this could pass as a manual modification of the game (which is visually detectable very easily), something MT cannot be held responsible for (it's like replacing default textures with inappropriate ones). Or at the very least, this acts as a configuration switch that is not accessible from the program itself, and can also be protected via file system permissions.<br /><br />I think that opening a file system explorer on a desktop machine and deleting a file should be easy enough if one knows where to find it. The protection is not perfect and does not have to be kept secret either. It is meant to block potentially inappropriate contents for the most sensitive users (young children).</div>

Please browse trough the 96 previous posts to find the answer. :P<br /><br />@rubenwardy: So the bar for violence is PEGI7? Or is it PEGI12? Or maybe PEGI16? Or still just PEGI3 (=BABY level)? Is this an official statement?

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>ShadMOrdre wrote:</cite>@Wuzzy,<br /><br />My sincerest apologies to anyone who is actually arguing the licensing issue, which is at the heart of this discussion, and yet lost in the censorship debate.  I do not accuse anyone of anything, BUT, as a parent, I will always question the mentality and intentions of those who promote inappropriate content to children.<br /><br />I am a parent.  When I take my child to the local park, I immediately call into question, and perhaps call the authorities, when I observe ANYONE acting in a way that is not appropriate to the situation.  The guy off to the side, being the creep.  Stranger Danger.  This is what we HAVE to teach our kids.  Don't blame me for this, blame the creeps.<br /><br />The internet is the public park, in this case.  Let's not try to separate the two.  The creep at the park is of the same mentality as the person lurking behind a keyboard, pushing inappropriate content.  Sorry, I am a parent.  This is how it is.  This isn't gonna change, until the creeps stop being creeps.  Don't get mad at me for protecting my child.  Get mad at the creep.  Shame them.  Call them out.<br /><br />As for the licensing issues that are actually at the heart of this discussion, there is no problem with the adult content.  I am just asking for discretion.  For my child.  When in game, the CDB is just a tab away, and inappropriate content, that could be DETRIMENTAL to his well being, would too readily available.  Here on the forums, which are NOT accessible in game, there is absolutely no problem with the innappropriate content.  My own opinions regarding sexualized content in a kids game aside, the forums are the appropriate location to host and promote those mods.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Second Life / Opensimulator, you'll get the following analogies.  Second Life is/was a commercial, proprietary sandbox world.  A centralized server was hosted by Linden Labs, and this was the Second Life universe.  Second Life/Linden Labs had in place policies to limit the interactions of adults and children, they had age verification controls, and the client/viewer app had links to the forums built in, and their was just no way to prevent kids and adults from interacting.<br /><br />Users began to rebel. They wanted land.  They wanted more control.  They wanted less restrictions.<br /><br />Thus was born Opensimulator, an open source, protocol compliant alternative.  Opensim was great, you could host your own servers, and using one of the SecondLife based open source clients, one could have complete control over their virtual sandbox world.  Very importantly, concerned parents could better manage the use of the technology by their children.  To this day, if I run the OS server, I have no problems allowing my son to use the software.<br /><br />I would never have recommended to a parent to allow their child into Second Life, but did and still do actively promote the Opensim alternative as a local option, that could still be shared amongst friends.<br /><br />MT is at this stage.  But is one step better.  It is FAR more kid friendly out of the box.  I'd simply like to encourage maintaining this.<br /><br />Sorry for all the vitriol here.  I gotta keep my kid safe.  I do hope, from one modder and community member to another, that you would also have good intentions, understand my position, and forgive me my failures.<br /><br />Wuzzy,     Thank you for calling me out about my strongly worded opinions and reminding me that we do all need to get along.  :)</div></blockquote><br /><br />Why do so many parents let their kids play Second Life? I read an article that said something like &quot;our kids spend hours of their time on Second Life&quot;. First I thought this was a joke, but when I later saw that a bunch of my friend's sons and daughters played this <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/website-reviews/second-life/user-reviews/child" class="postlink">fucked up game</a> I was bewildered.<br />Even the title and the ads for this game contain inapprioriate elements that I'm not going to mention here.</div>
