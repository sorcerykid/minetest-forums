			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>ShadMOrdre wrote:</cite>This discussion is good and all...it should keep going.  However, I'd like to point out some glaring issues.<br /><br />1.  If you find a problem, report it.  Give the developer time to respond.  In an opensource game, this could mean up to a year.  Patience.  If the issue is so pressing, either work towards fixing the problem, or quit using the product/software.  Crying about a problem does nothing.  Threatening to broadcasting a problem, for whatever reason, to force an issue is never the right way.  As a developer, I will tell you this.  Your threats will go ignored.  Issues might get addressed, if I as the developer, deem the issue important enough to address.  Your expectation of anything other than the above stated behavior is unrealistic.  You would act the same way if you were in those shoes.<br /><br />2.  If you build it, they will hack it.  Does this really need expounding upon?<br /><br />3.  Expecting an opensource game engine to provide any better security than your local run of the mill windows OS, with market cap to correct EVERY issue, well, again, totally unrealistic.<br /><br />4.  Security issues are always a delicate matter, and should be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.  Broadcasting security issues, regardless of the motivation, is only intended to do harm.  There is no other explanation or excuse.<br /><br />5.  Discretion is advised.  Otherwise, why bother posting the issue and waiting for a response.  Just broadcast the security hole and let the harm fly.<br /><br />AND MOST IMPORTANTLY....<br /><br />Get involved with the nuts and bolts of coding.  You cannot honestly expect anyone else to fix what ever you find, if you are not willing to at least help yourself.  Help those who are trying to help you.</div></blockquote> <br /><br />Up to a point, just because it's free as in free beer doesn't means they SHOULD take so long for a security flaw to be resolved/addressed. More than likely a &quot;hold&quot; of 90 or so days is reasonable depending on severely, complications and/or other reasonable means.  <br /><br />After that why give them the slack? One way or another you need to give some people a &quot;push&quot; to fix a outstanding issue if internal means fails for x amount of time (and not like a year in most cases).</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Mineminer wrote:</cite>Yea but up to a point, if people don't work internally after a reasonable length of time then isn't it fair to proceed with a responsible disclosure?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, but I don't think that most people understand what that means. It doesn't mean you publish zero day exploits without warning to users, for instance.  <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Mineminer wrote:</cite>Or are you saying that if there serious issues that they may be left unchecked for goodness how long that could lead to serious damages just because the software is not bonded by law to do so? </div></blockquote><br /><br />That is why this is so difficult. There is not a single scenario that you can follow here because all vulnerabilities are different. If you're dealing with a potentially crippling bug for pacemakers, you will likely have to act differently than a bug in a tamagochi.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Mineminer wrote:</cite>So in other words if someone gave someone a &quot;comprised&quot; meal with such disclaimers because the meal was free they will be totally fine to resolve their issues at &quot;their pace&quot; even if that means it's take a year to understand why the person gotten sick of the meal? Yea no thanks, even if that meal I was free I would still expect a full accountability for who ever did such actions (cross contamination, used wrong items, used rotting produce and/or etc etc etc).  <br /><br />Same idea here I expect to be able to &quot;consume&quot; the software without having to worry about serious issues happening down the road.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I actually *like* that you expect full accountability, and more and more software makers are being held accountable if they are professionals and work for companies. However, that isn't the case for amateurs - you are still properly shielded from liability laws if you use good liability waivers and statements of no warranty. This isn't necessarily good, but it allows Free Software to be what it is today, and grow to the next level that it needs to be at.<br /><br />Please note that even programs like Microsoft Windows essentially has no warranty (it's a paper thin warranty, essentially) and they guarantee you pretty much nothing.<br /><br />The *good* thing about all this is that Free Software can be audited, and proprietary software can not. So you can, and every one can, do a full analysis of the security issues, and you can create and issue fixes for it. And this brings me back to the collaborative part of doing OSS security disclosures - you don't make friends if you threaten with a unilateral disclosure schedule and refuse to cooperate, and honestly if you have that attitude, you shouldn't be reviewing OSS software for security issues - go ahead and do that to proprietary software instead.</div>

Do you write mods?<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>micheal65536 wrote:</cite>Why do you expect the individual mod developers to fix their mods when you could fix the core and squash between 75% and 90% of current Minetest vulnerabilities once and for all and leave mod developers in peace?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Because that would make stuff not work anymore that currently does. Things like fsc is *not* a solution for many use cases, these can't be protected that way and need special handling.</div>

			<div class="content">So, this is a discussion, right?  I see many misunderstandings about how things simply work in the real world.<br /><br />This isn't just an IT, Programmer/User, developer versus the world kinda thing.  We all need to realize that our own expectations must simply be realistic.  Expecting anything of anyone is not realistic.  Asking for assistance, offering assistance, generally helping out to make things better.  Those are the things that are realistic.<br /><br />Responsible reporting means reporting, being patient with a response, and seeking guidance as to the next step if there is no response.  &quot;Hey, I found a huge, gaping hole!&quot;, and then blasting that info is not responsible.  It is either bourne of ignorance or agenda.  The big tech corps used to do this to each other, then realized, it isn't in anyones best interest, and stopped.  Protocols were established.<br /><br />New protocol recommendation.<br />If you find a gaping security hole, report it to the appropriate developer, whether this be a mod or an engine issue.  If the issue is severe enough, consider reporting mods to the mod author as well as the engine dev team.  Engine dev team, consider a protocol for this, in case the mod exploits an engine fault, or is otherwise dangerous.  This has already been approached due to the CSM issue.<br /><br />If you have found an issue, please be patient.  This being a community developed project, not a corporate sponsored project, you must lower your expectations of a timely response.  As pointed out, certain licenses do not contain any expectation of warranty, and so your (continued) use of any &quot;faulty&quot; software product is not only at your own risk, but you are still bound by the terms of the license, regarding disclosure.  Blasting any exploit can be considered a violation of the license, if it is interpreted in such way in a court of law.  For your own protection, tread lightly.  As a developer, this is my official legal position, and this is what I will argue in court.<br /><br />Please act as responsibly as you expect others to also do.</div>

There's a thread about checksum or hash value somewhere.   I think it's the best method to prevent cheating and server opwners should be given this choice. The reasons I hear the developers and others speak against it is &quot;they want to customise their textures, sounds ect.&quot; Well buzz off and play on a server that doesnt run the check then.   There's no reason not to have offical builds with as many os and distros as possible and a checksum for servers and clients to be sure they're connecting clean and not wasting their time fucking around with a bunch of trolls and evil nerd hackers.</div>

			<div class="content">May be it wont be easy and I'm not a real dev as I don't formally study computer science but we can refer to something like linux kernel ecosystem, it is open source and can be made very secure. Any build by anyone based on official linux source will be guaranteed to have equal level of security. It doesn't have to be core devs responsibility at least a PR can be an eye opener. It doesn't have to be limited to only prebuilt version but anyone who want to enjoy playing clean can do it.</div>

I've tried other games like Xonotic that has decent security (encryption option and a display if a server is running official) and players tell me assholes ddos what was once popular servers.  I wish these people would die so I can enjoy something.  I look at the minetest server list and see some interesting survival servers but why bother?  Some evil nerd will ruin the contest.</div>

Just because MT lets you build a game server by piling mods on top of mods, doesn't mean the resulting game will be good - both on the gameplay side and on the administration side.</div>
